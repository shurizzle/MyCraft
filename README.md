MyCraft
=======

Set of tools to play minecraft as premium on your server, LIKE A BOSS.

You can install the launcher with:
```bash
sudo gem install launchcraft
```
and run it with:
```bash
minecraft -h
```

You can run the server compiling the lib with:
```bash
make HOST="your.fuckin.host"
```
and run the server with:
```bash
LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/getaddrfake.so java -X... bukkit.jar
```

But, first of all, run the auth server :D
